    // PRIMITIVES DATA TYPES
    //primitive type of "int". Primitive types contain the minimum requirements to store the variable as an integer. No other built in features are available. The benefit of this is that it takes up less memory. The down side is it has less built in functions available
    int x = 5;

    // OBJECT TYPE (Class Wrappers)
    //Integer is an object type. Different from primitive type "int" b/c it comes with more built in features and still lets you store int types. Benefit is that it gives you more built in functions for the variable. Downside is it takes up more memory
